### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('🎉')
}
```

### Continued development


### Useful resources

- [Add SASS to Svelte JS with svelte-preprocess](https://linguinecode.com/post/add-sass-svelte-js) - Using Sass with Svelte JS is a little different than using it with React or Vue. This article helped me get Sass working with Svelte JS.

- [Svelte Interactive course](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/classes) - This is the official Svelte JS tutorial. It's a great resource for learning Svelte JS, from state management to component creation.

- [Svelte Native accordion](https://svelte.dev/repl/74ff0da7cb074d4788b996e2d91258d3?version=3.23.0) - This is a great ressource for creating a native group of accordion components in Svelte JS. I used this to create the accordion component in this project.
