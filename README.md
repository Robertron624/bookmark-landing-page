## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) - JS library
- [SaSS](https://sass-lang.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

This was my first solo Svelte JS project. I learned how to use Svelte JS to create components and how to use Svelte JS to manage state. I also learned how to use Svelte JS to create a responsive navigation menu, binding form inputs, conditional classes and some animations for the accordion menus.
I found Svelte JS to be a very intuitive framework to use and easy to create basic UI elements like modals and accordion menus. I was able to pick up the basics of Svelte JS in a few hours and was able to create this project in a few days. I'm looking forward to using Svelte JS in future projects.

### Continued development
I want to keep using Svelte JS in future projects along with react. I want to learn how to use Svelte JS to create more complex UI elements like carousels and sliders. I also want to learn how to use Svelte JS to create more complex animations. Maybe even use Svelte Kit to create a full stack application.


### Useful resources

- [Add SASS to Svelte JS with svelte-preprocess](https://linguinecode.com/post/add-sass-svelte-js) - Using Sass with Svelte JS is a little different than using it with React or Vue. This article helped me get Sass working with Svelte JS.

- [Svelte Interactive course](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/classes) - This is the official Svelte JS tutorial. It's a great resource for learning Svelte JS, from state management to component creation.

- [Svelte Native accordion](https://svelte.dev/repl/74ff0da7cb074d4788b996e2d91258d3?version=3.23.0) - This is a great ressource for creating a native group of accordion components in Svelte JS. I used this to create the accordion component in this project.

- [Svelte Modal](https://svelte.dev/examples/modal) - This is a great resource for creating a modal component in Svelte JS. I used this to create the mobile navigation menu in this project.
